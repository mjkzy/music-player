## Why

i don't really like paying for streaming services, especially for some of the music i listen to. this project was a nice way for me to share music between my phone & pc quickly and easy. plus, while on mobile, you can play music and leave the site without the music pausing. i created this within a little less than a week just for fun ðŸ˜€
